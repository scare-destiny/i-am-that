Q: Please tell me, must I lose all by losing the 'I'? M: You may or you may not. It will be all the same to you. Your loss will be somebody's gain. You will not mind. Q: If I do not mind, I shall lose all! M: Once you have nothing you have no problems. Q: I am left with the problem of survival. M: It is the body's problem and it will solve it by eating, drinking and sleeping. There is enough for all, provided all share. Q: Our society is based on grabbing, not on sharing. M: By sharing you will change it.
