M: You discover that there is nothing to discover. You are what you are and that is all. Q: I do not understand! M: It is your fixed idea that you must be something or other, that blinds you. Q: How can I get rid of this idea? M: If you trust me, believe when I tell you that you are the pure awareness that illuminates consciousness and its infinite content. Realise this and live accordingly. If you do not believe me, then go within, enquiring ‘What an I’? or, focus your mind on ‘I am’, which is pure and simple being.
