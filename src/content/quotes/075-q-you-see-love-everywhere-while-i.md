Q: You see love everywhere, while I see hatred and suffering. The history of humanity is the history of murder, individual and collective. No other living being so delights in killing. M: If you go into the motives, you will find love, love of oneself and of one's own. People fight for what they imagine they love. Q: Surely their love must be real enough when they are ready to die for it. M: Love is boundless. What is limited to a few cannot be called love. Q: Do you know such unlimited love? M: Yes, l do. Q: How does it feel? M: All is loved and lovable. Nothing is excluded. Q: Not even the ugly and the criminal? M: All is within my consciousness; all is my own. It is madness to split oneself through likes and dislikes. I am beyond both. I am not alienated. Q: To be free from like and dislike is a state of indifference. M: It may look and feel so in the beginning. Persevere in such indifference and it will blossom into an all-pervading and all-embracing love.
