Accept life as it comes and you will find it a blessing. Q: I can accept my own life. How can I accept the sort of life others are compelled to live? M: You are accepting it anyhow. The sorrows of others do not interfere with your pleasures. If you were really compassionate, you would have abandoned long ago all self-concern and entered the state from which alone you can really help.
