M: Does love act deliberately? Yes and no. Life is love and love is life. What keeps the body together but love? What is desire, but love of the self? What is fear but the urge to protect? And what is knowledge but the love of truth? The means and forms may be wrong, but the motive behind is always love â€” love of the me and the mine. The me and the mine may be small, or may explode and embrace the universe, but love remains.
